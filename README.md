Python notebook with code, free text and plots
Learning outcomes assessed 
1. Practice skills in measurements, analysis, synthesis and integration of information, and in the application of related theoretical knowledge, where relevant.
3. You will be able to perform. simple operations on Linux systems (e.g. moving between and managing directories, text editing)
4. You will be able to design and execute efficient, simple computer programs (in Python) for reading, manipulating, analysing (including plotting) and outputting data
5. You will be able to diagnose and correct errors in code
Assignment length/Time limit guidance 
No length limit for code, individual word limits for text sections
Use of GenAI in this assessment 
RED: AI tools cannot be used You must not use GenAI tools. The purpose and format of the assessments makes it inappropriate or impractical for AI tools to be used.

Submission method 
Submit the coursework file by copying it into the “paleoclimate_coursework_submission” folder in your home directory on Jupyterhub. The time and date of submission is recorded automatically.
Feedback provision 
Usually, you will receive your feedback before your next assessment for the module is due. Where it is appropriate to do so, and feedback can be released without invalidating the integrity of ongoing assessments, this will typically be no later than 15 working days post submission. Please be mindful that some students may have approved extensions for assessments which mean it is not appropriate to release feedback within 15 working days after individual submissions. In these cases, feedback will be released no later than 15 working days following the submission of all outstanding work for the assessment. Feedback on course will be incorporated into the graded work and returned to your home directory. Feedback will follow each question and will note how the question can be better answered.

Assignment summary guidance 
The assignment is a python notebook that can be copied into your home directory in the same way as the weekly worksheets. Please see the guidance on Minerva for this. You will use python code to analyse, plot and interpret climate model data for a modern simulation and for the Last Glacial Maximum, a period of expanded ice sheet cover around 20 thousand years ago. Detailed instructions are provided as part of each individual section within the python notebook. A supplementary document is also provided on Minerva that includes details of the climate model setup which will help you locate the correct output files to work with.
Use of GenAI 
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools cannot be used on this assessment. This assessment is designed to demonstrate foundation-level skills like developing code structure and debugging that are essential to your programme. While professional programmers may work successfully with GenAI tools, this is only possible because they have learned the foundation-level skills which enable them to guide and check the work of the AI.

Assessment criteria and process 
Marks are assigned by these broad criteria:
40% of the marks for code functionality i.e. did you get the correct answer
30% of the marks for figure presentation and coding style.
30% of the marks for your interpretation of the results
This assessment has standard deadline and length penalties. Word counts are given for individual written sections. For information on late penalties and assignment length requirement penalties see the Faculty CoPA or School Annex.
There is no assessment of technical written English in this coursework.
This assessment can be resat via a similar assessment method.
Presentation/Formatting and referencing 
There are no formatting requirements for text and no referencing is required. Figure formatting forms part of the assessment above.
